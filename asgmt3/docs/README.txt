- How to run
  1. Compile the program by using Makefile:
    - `$ make`
    - After this step, the executable file (named as "main") will be generated.

  2. Run the executable:
    - `$ ./main`
    - After this step, you will first see the generated prime, and then you can
      doing the encryption and decryption.
    - Note that to generate a 256-bit prime, we need to test for 12 times, so
      it may take about 10 seconds to 1 minutes.

  3. Delete the executable:
    - `$ make clean`
    - After this step, the executable file (named as "main") will be deleted.

- Example
  - Please see the image (named as "example.png") in the folder.
